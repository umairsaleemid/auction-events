>Hyperledger Fabric sample Using Event Handling with the next generation IBM Blockchain Platform 

This code pattern demonstrates leveraging the event handling feature within an application that is based on using an IKS cluster with IBM Blockchain Platform V2.0 service on IBM Cloud.  We apply this use case to an auction use case. It shows how events can be emitted by using the Hyperledger Fabric SDK and subscribed to by external applications.  The application is implemented in Node.js and is using the Hyperledger Fabric SDK for node.js to connect with the network, set up an event listener and catch transactional events.

A client application may use the Fabric Node.js client to register a "listener" to receive blocks as they are added to the channel ledger. This is known as "channel-based events", and it allows a client to start to receive blocks from a specific block number, allowing event processing to run normally on blocks that may have been missed. The Fabric Node.js client can also assist client applications by processing the incoming blocks and looking for specific transactions or chaincode events. This allows a client application to be notified of transaction completion or arbitrary chaincode events without having to perform multiple queries or search through the blocks as they are received.  After the transaction proposal has been successfully endorsed, and before the transaction message has been successfully broadcasted to the orderer, the application should register a listener to be notified of the event when the transaction achieves finality, which is when the block containing the transaction gets added to the peer's ledger/blockchain. 

Fabric committing peers provides an event stream to publish blocks to registered listeners. A Block gets published whenever the committing peer adds a validated block to the ledger. There are three ways to register a listener to get notified:

* register a `block listener` to get called for every block event. The listener will be passed a fully decoded Block object.

* register a `transaction listener` to get called when the specific transaction by id is committed (discovered inside a published block). The listener will be passed the transaction id, transaction status and block number.

* register a `chaincode event listener` to get called when a specific chaincode event has arrived. The listener is be passed the ChaincodeEvent, block number, transaction id, and transaction status. 

In this pattern we are registering a transaction event. So when a transaction is completed/committed - an event will get triggered and the application will catch it and report it. 

Audience level : Intermediate Developers

If you have an IBM Cloud Lite account, you can also use the IBM Blockchain Platform Service free for 30 days to do this pattern. Additionally, IKS is free too.


When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Package the smart contract using IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code

# Running the application

Follow these steps to set up and run this code pattern. The steps are described in detail below.

### Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Package the smart contract](#2-package-the-smart-contract)
3. [Create IBM Cloud services](#3-create-ibm-cloud-services)
4. [Build a network](#4-build-a-network)
5. [Deploy Auction Event Smart Contract on the network](#5-deploy-auctionevent-smart-contract-on-the-network)
6. [Connect application to the network](#6-connect-application-to-the-network)
7. [Run the application](#7-run-the-application)


## 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository in a folder of your choice:

```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/auction-events.git
```

# 2. Package the smart contract

We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform extension to package the smart contract.
* Open Visual Studio code and open the `contract` folder from  `auction-events` that was cloned earlier.

* Press the `F1` key to see the different VS code options. Choose `IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-images/vs-code-options.png">
</p>


* Click the `IBM Blockchain Platform` extension button on the left. This will show the packaged contracts on top and the blockchain connections on the bottom. **Note** You will see `auction@0.0.1` instead of globalfinancing@1.0.0.


<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="docs/doc-images/ibm-blockchain-extension.png">
</p>

* Next, right click on the packaged contract (in this case, select auction@0.0.1) to export it and choose `Export Package`.

* Choose a location on your machine and save `.cds` file.  We will use this packages smart contract later to deploy on the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 service.


Now, we will start creating our Hyperledger Fabric network on the IBM Cloud.

## 3. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes).  You can find the service in the `Catalog`.  For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name.  Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster and expires after 30 days.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-kubernetes-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/) service on the IBM Cloud.  You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-blockchain-2-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform on the cluster.  The service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/deploy-blockchain-on-cluster.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start operating on your blockchain network.

    "userName": "user1",
    "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
 }
```

## 7. Run the application

* #### Enroll admin
  - First, navigate to the `application` directory, and install the node dependencies.
  
    ```bash
    cd application
    npm install
    ```

  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
  
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

This will create a directory called `wallet` and insert the user Admin along with its certificate authority.

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
  
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user app-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```


  - In the newest version of the Hyperledger Fabric Node SDK (1.4 release) there are 
  three main event types that can be subscribed to
    1. <b>Contract events</b> - these have to be emitted from the chaincode by calling the
    [stub.setEvent(name,payload) method](https://fabric-shim.github.io/master/fabric-shim.ChaincodeStub.html#setEvent__anchor). An example can be seen 
    in the auction chaincode on [line 141 of contract/lib/auction.js](https://github.com/IBM/auction-events/blob/master/contract/lib/auction.js#L141). These types of 
    events are great, since you can customize exactly what data you want to send 
    to the client application. Note that these events will only be triggered once 
    a certain function within your chaincode is called. 
    2. <b>Transaction (Commit) events</b> - these are automatically emitted 
    after a transaction is committed to the ledger.
    3. <b> Block events </b> - these are emitted automatically when a block is committed. 
    Note that there can be mutliple transactions in a block, so you may get multiple
    transaction events for one block event.
  
## 8. Emit Contract Events

  - To illustrate each of these three main event types, we will have a separate script
  for each, that will show each of the events in action. First, let's check out the 
  `contractEvents.js` file. This file uses the `addContractListener` function to 
  look for any `TradeEvent` events that may be published from our chaincode. You can 
  see in our `contract` directory, that our `StartBidding`, `Offer`, and `CloseBidding` 
  functions all emit an event my calling `await ctx.stub.setEvent('TradeEvent', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(tradeEvent)));` Then, our callback function in our `contractEvents.js` 
  file will fire once it has 
  detected that the `TradeEvent` is sent. Go ahead and run `contractEvents.js` by 
  typing in the following command in terminal

  ```javascript
    application$ node contractEvents.js 
    Wallet path: /Users/Horea.Porutiu@ibm.com/Workdir/testDir/auction-events/application/wallet
    gateway connect
    ************************ Start Trade Event *******************************************************
    type: Start Auction
    ownerId: auction@acme.org
    id: l1
    description: Sample Product
    status: {"code":1,"text":"FOR_SALE"}
    amount: 50
    buyerId: auction@acme.org
    Block Number: 124 Transaction ID: 
    6be255d6c2ab968ab9f0bd4bbc3477f51f1e02512d11e86fc509f2f6f0e51a7e Status: VALID
    ************************ End Trade Event ************************************
    closebiddingResponse: 
    {"listingId":"l1","offers":[{"bidPrice":100,"memberId":"memberB@acme.org"},{"bidPrice":50,"memberId":"memberA@acme.org"}],"productId":"p1","reservePrice":50,"state":"{\"code\":3,\"text\":\"SOLD\"}"}
    Transaction to close the bidding has been submitted
  ```

  This above output parses the trade event - it shows us the type of the event, the owner, the id, 
  the description of the product the status, etc. This is all things we have built and emitted within 
  our chaincode. Great. Now that we understand how contract events work, let's move onto the block 
  event listener. 

## 9. Emit Block Events

  - Block events are different than contract events since you have less control of what exactly 
  is being output. Go ahead and check out `blockEvents.js`. Note that there may be multiple 
  transactions within one block, and you can edit how many transactions are in your block by 
  editing the block batch size for a channel. You can read more details about this 
  [here](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/config_update.html). 
  The main components of the block are the block header, the block data, and the block
  metadata. 
    - The <b>block header</b> contains the block number, (starting at 0 from the genesis block)
    and increased by 1 for every new block appended to the blockchain. It also has 
    the current block hash (the hash of all transactions in the current block), and 
    the previous block hash.
    - The <b>block data</b> contains a list of the transactions in order. 
    - The <b>block metadata</b> contains the time when the block was written,
    the certificate, public key and signature of the block writer.

  - Go ahead and run the `blockEvents.js` script by typing in the following 
  commands in the terminal. For each `contract.submitTransaction` we submit,
  we will have a new block added to the ledger.
  Notice the output will be divided by header, 
  data, and metadata. You can then parse those respective parts of the output 
  to learn more about each specific part of the block.

  ```javascript
  application$ node blockEvents.js 
  Wallet path: /Users/Horea.Porutiu@ibm.com/Workdir/testDir/auction-events/application/wallet
  gateway connect

## 10. Emit Transaction Events
  - Lastly, let's go ahead and listen for transaction events. This is even more 
  granular than block events, since multiple transactions can comprise a block.
  We will use the `transaction.addCommitListener` to listen to transactions. Go 
  ahead and look at the `transactionEvents.js` file. What we are doing, is that we are 
  adding a committ listener, such that when we submit a transaction, and it is 
  committed, we will get the transactionId, status, and blockheight back. Go 
  ahead and run `transactionEvents.js` file, and you should see the following 
  output in your terminal: 

  ```javascript
  application$ node transactionEvents.js 
  Wallet path: /Users/Horea.Porutiu@ibm.com/Workdir/testDir/auction-events/application/wallet
  gateway connect
  transaction committed
  'ef7f833d6039e41c5054d0bba0d327cfc14bfd7be836a6c5e65547320880d1af'
  'VALID'
  405
  transaction committed end
  Transaction to add seller has been submitted
  application$ 
  ```

 - Nice job! You've now learned how to 

## Troubleshooting

* If you receive the following error on submitting transaction:
`error: [Client.js]: Channel not found for name mychannel`

  It is safe to ignore this error because the ibp2.0 beta has service discovery enabled. (In order to use service discovery to find other peers please define anchor peers for your channel in the ui). If you really want the message to go away you can add the channels section to the connection profile, but it is a warning rather than a true error telling the user the channel is found but not in the connection profile 

  As an example you can manually add the following json and updated the IP address and ports manually:

  ```
  "channels": {
          "mychannel": {
              "orderers": [
                  "169.46.208.151:32078"
              ],
              "peers": {
                  "169.46.208.151:31017": {}
              }
          }
      },
  ```

* In the invoke-emit.js application, you will see the following code:
It is important to note that in order for the `getClient` method to actually get the connection.profile content, you need to have line #4 occur before line #6.  If you don't, then the `client` constant will be `null`.  It is important you have the order correct to run the code successfully.

```bash
1. // A gateway defines the peers used to access Fabric networks
    
2.    await gateway.connect(ccp, { wallet, identity: appAdmin , discovery: {enabled: true, asLocalhost:false }});
3.    console.log('Connected to Fabric gateway.');

4.   const network = await gateway.getNetwork(channelName);
5.    // Get addressability to network

6.    const client = gateway.getClient();
    
7.    const channel = client.getChannel('mychannel');
8.    console.log('Got addressability to channel');
    
9.    const channel_event_hub = channel.getChannelEventHub('173.193.79.114:30324');
```

## Extending the code pattern
This application can be expanded in a couple of ways:
* Create a wallet for every member and use the member's wallet to interact with the application.
* Add a UI application in place of the `invoke.js` node application to execute the transactions.
